    "Hello All ! This is pretty basic tutorial to start off with **Convolutional networks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a bit of introduction Convolutional neural networks are primarily used to classify images or identify pattern similarities between them. So a convolutional network receives a normal color image as a rectangular box whose width and height are measured by the number of pixels along those dimensions, and whose depth is three layers deep, one for each letter in RGB. Those depth layers are referred to as **channels**. For simplification needs we will only consider gray scale image here.\n",
    "\n",
    "As images move through a convolutional network, different patterns are recognised just like a normal neural network. But here rather than focussing on one pixel at a time, a convolutional net takes in square patches of pixels and passes them through a **filter**. That filter is also a square matrix smaller than the image itself, and equal in size to the patch. It is also called a **kernel**.\n",

You can also experiment with different values here like 32, 128 etc. Also we have to specify input shape which is your X shape. Activation we will take 'relu' for now however there are many others to experiment with.\n",

    "7. We will now add a Dense layer of 64 nodes. Note for all these layers we are using activation as 'relu' because I found results better with this. You can skip specifying activation but this might make a model a conveniently linear which might not work for us.\n",
    "8. In the end for getting our result we will add final Dense layer . Activation can be sigmoid or softmax (if you need probability use sigmoid else use softmax). Here I have used sigmoid.\n",
    "9. Finally we will compile the model . There are 3 things to mention here . Loss, Optimizer, Metrics\n",
    "\n",

    "**Optimizer** :- If you know a lil bit about mathematics of machine learning you might be familier with local minima or global minima or cost function.
